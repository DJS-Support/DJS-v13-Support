### Error_Installing_Module_With_NPM
```javascript
- Have you imported the module? 'npm i <module name>'
- Have you typed it correctly to what's on the npm site?
- Does this module exist
- Have you ran "npm i"
- Is your npm on the newest version? 'npm install -g npm@latest'
```
**If you haven't said yes to all of these follow this**

> If you haven't imported the package, `npm i <package name>`

> If you haven't typed it correctly to what's shown on the npm site, correct it and retry

> Check npm website [NPM]() to see if the module actually exists 

> If you haven't run "npm i" in your terminal then run it to setup your code

> Check your npm version run "npm -v" in your terminal. If it isn't 8.3.0 or higher run "npm install -g npm@latest" in your terminal

**If you've done all of this go to [Here]()**
